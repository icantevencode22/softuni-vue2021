Single repo containing examples, assignments, homeworks and general tasks showed in SoftUni's Vue Jan 2021 Course https://softuni.bg/trainings/3279/vuejs-january-2021

## Projects setup
We are mainly focusing on Vue 2 / Options API, if we manage to showcase Vue 3 / Composition API this will be outlined in the specific project. 

All projects are created via [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html) (`@vue/cli 4.5.9`). Vue 2 projects are created from the default option.
